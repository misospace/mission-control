/**
 * Turn repeated CI failures on a repository's default branch into issues.
 *
 * `pr-followup` already ingests a failing check when it happens on a pull
 * request. The same failure on the default branch reaches nothing: it has no
 * PR, so nothing ingests it and nothing files anything. A release build that
 * breaks after a merge is therefore invisible to the queue.
 *
 * The policy this implements, and why:
 *
 * - **Only a second consecutive failure files.** One red run is weak evidence:
 *   network blips and rate limits are common and clear themselves. Two in a
 *   row with the same signature is a condition, not an accident.
 * - **Every workflow is eligible.** The repeat rule is the noise filter. An
 *   allowlist would silently exclude whichever workflow nobody remembered to
 *   add, which is the failure this exists to catch.
 * - **A second consecutive green closes the issue.** An auto-filed issue
 *   nobody auto-closes goes stale the moment CI recovers, and a queue of stale
 *   auto-issues trains people to ignore the label. But one green after a red
 *   is as weak a signal as one red after a green, so it does not close — a
 *   workflow that legitimately alternates red and green would otherwise be
 *   closed on every green and refiled on every red, looping at the sync
 *   interval (#953). Two greens in a row is the same "a condition, not an
 *   accident" bar the file side already applies.
 * - **A recurrence files fresh, linking the old one.** A failure returning
 *   after its issue closed means the fix did not hold — new information, and it
 *   should re-enter the queue with its own priority rather than reopening an
 *   issue whose body describes a different occurrence.
 *
 * Deliberately holds no state of its own. Consecutiveness is read from the
 * workflow's own recent runs, and "already filed" from a marker in the issue
 * body — so there is no table to migrate and an instance that has never seen a
 * repo behaves exactly like one that has.
